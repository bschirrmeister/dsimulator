Q:  How do I build fuzzy Packets ?
A:  By the momment, this features is activated only for DHCP packets. 
    The DHCP_Idle constructor receives a parameter "fuzzPackets" ( off by default ), which
    allow to create fuzzy packets ( with a 90% of fuzz ). 

    ie. self.spawn( dhcp.DHCP_Idle(fuzzPackets=True), name="DHCP")
    will create a dhcp layer where every packet will be fuzzed
