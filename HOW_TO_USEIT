There are different scenarios where you can use. 

You will need:
	1. DHCP server ( I'm using ISC dhcp server and you can download at www.isc.org )
	2. DHCP server should have an scope for the CMTS network. So,if your virtualCMTS is configured
	   with IP 31.0.0.1, then your DHCP server should have an scope for this LAN 
           Here is my DHCP Server configuration

		# avoid ping before allocate		
		ping-check false; 
	  	# add a scope for CMTS subnet 
		subnet 31.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 {
			range 31.0.0.2 31.0.254.254;
			default-lease-time 6000;
		}

Description of different scenarios where you will be able to use it.

1. Everything in one machine.
	0. Ensure DHCP server is running
	1. The DHCP server must know how to route packets from CMTS to the simulator
		sudo route add -net CMTS_NETWORK netmask  MASK dev eth0
	2. Need to avoid arp request, so... ( no arp proxy, by the momment )
		sudo arp -s IPCMTS CMTS_MACADDRESS
	3. start simulator 
		sudo python2.5 simulator.py
	4. run 1cm.py from the sample files
		python 1cm.py	
		# have in mind you shoud edit sample files to run in your network
		# with the ipaddress where the simulator is running and the CMTS 
	You should see on server side and client side, 1 device had just acquire IP.

2. Two machines on the same lan
	0. Ensure DHCP server is running
	1. Server A : DHCP server up and running
	2. Server A : DHCP server must know how to route packets from CMTS to the simulator 
		sudo route add -net CMTS_NETWORK netmask  MASK dev eth0
	3. Note : Because we are running on different hosts on the same LAN, no need to fix arp entry table.
	4. Server B : simulator up and running
	5. Verify the sample to execute ( 1cm.py ), verify where the SimulatorBridge is instanciated, it should point to the simulator ip address. 
		simulator = SimulatorBridge('IP WHERE SIMULATOR RUNS',10003)
		# should also verified where the CMTS is created (setupCMTS)
		
	6. run a sample file and verify logs
		python 1cm.py

	You should see on server side and client side, 1 device had just acquire IP.


[ Samples ] 
1cm.py     		: Boot 1 Cable Modem
1cm_renew.py    : Boot 1 Cable Modem and show how to force a renew 
bootmeassures   : Boot some virtual devices and meassures how much time takes per device to acquire IP
manyCMs.py 		: Boot as many Cable Modems as you want. In this sample, you will see power_on and dhcp_discover messages splitted. This is becouse, if you are trying to simulate thousands of devices, it will take a while.
