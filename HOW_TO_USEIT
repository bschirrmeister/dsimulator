There are different scenarios where you can use. 

You will need:
	1. DHCP server ( I'm using ISC dhcp server and you can download at www.isc.org )
	2. DHCP server should have an scope for the CMTS network. So,if your virtualCMTS is configured
	   with IP 31.0.0.1, then your DHCP server should have an scope for this LAN 
           Here is my DHCP Server configuration

		# avoid ping before allocate		
		ping-check false; 
	  	# add a scope for CMTS subnet 
		subnet 31.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 {
			range 31.0.0.2 31.0.254.254;
			default-lease-time 6000;
		}

	
Description of different scenarios where you will be able to use it.

1. Everything in one machine.
	1. The DHCP server must know how to route packets from CMTS to the simulator
		sudo route add -net CMTS_NETWORK netmask  MASK dev eth0
	2. Need to avoid arp request, so... ( no arp proxy, by the momment )
		sudo arp -s IPCMTS CMTS_MACADDRESS
	3. start simulator 
		sudo python2.5 simulator.py
	4. run 1cm.py from the sample files
		python 1cm.py
	You should see on server side and client side, 1 device had just acquire IP.

2. Two machines on the same lan
	1. Server A : DHCP server up and running
	2. Server A : The DHCP server must know how to route packets from CMTS to the simulator 
		sudo route add -net CMTS_NETWORK netmask  MASK dev eth0
	3. Note : Becouse we are running on different hosts on the same LAN, no need to fix arp entry table.
	4. Server B : simulator up and running
	5. Verify the sample to execute ( 1cm.py ), verify where the SimulatorBridge is instanciated, it should point to the simulator ip address. 
		simulator = SimulatorBridge('IP WHERE SIMULATOR RUNS',10003)
	6. run 1cm.py sample file
		python 1cm.py
	You should see on server side and client side, 1 device had just acquire IP.
