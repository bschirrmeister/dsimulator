[2 - Questions]

Q - What is this 
A - This is a very first opensource network device simulator. It allows to simulate ( by terms of network traffic ) 
in a realistic way, how different network devices works. 

Q - Why ?
A - Becouse it is fun. Becouse if you use to play/develop with network devices you will understand how complex 
is to deploy something when you need the device at your side. Moreover, if you need to recreate a huge amount of devices,
you simply can not buy hundreds of thounsands of devices "just for test". So here we are. Now, you will be able to simulate
as many devices as you'd like :)
By the momment, you will be able to play with basic cablemodems, but more functionality/devices/layers are comming.

Q - Is this project close ?
A - Absolutely no ! Actually, I had developed more layers / modules which will allow more realistic and complex simulations.
Some layers are developed / under the radar are : CMTS , ARP , ICMP ( so you can ping virtual devices as if the where 
real !), TFTP, DNS , NTP, VirtualPCs, TR-069 devices, IPCameras , and so on.....

Q - When those layers will be released ?
A - The schedule is not set and may vary uppon demand. 

Q - How can i contribute ?
A - Join to the mailing list. Submit your fix / patch. 

Q - Do you need financial support 
A - By the momment, this project its been developed in my spare time. Feel free to send me your contribution.

Q - I need to simulate device XXXX Could you please create the virtual device for me.
A - If I have time and the device is requested by many people i will do my best. 
    If you want to pay for it, for sure i will have tiem :)
